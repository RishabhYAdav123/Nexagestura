# Nexagestura
NexaGestura is a gesture-based system for controlling volume and brightness using hand movements. It uses OpenCV, MediaPipe, and Python to track gestures in real-time, providing a seamless, touch-free experience. No extra hardware is neededâ€”just a webcam! Future plans include custom gestures and voice integration. ðŸš€
